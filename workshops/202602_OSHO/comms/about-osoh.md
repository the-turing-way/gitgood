# About Open Science Office Hours (OSHO)

https://openscienceofficehours.github.io/osoh_website/

The goal of OSOH is to empower students and researchers to make their work more open.
We do this by sharing and curating open-science resources, facilitating discussion, and offering individual assistance. A different Open Science theme is chosen every month. Through this mechanism we hope to make OSOH participants and followers discover new facets of Open Science that they might not have encountered before. Every month we welcome an expert on that theme, available for Office Hours timeslots throughout the month.

All of our lectures are recorded and posted on our youtube page, for "open" and "science" purposes: [www.youtube.com/@OpenScienceOfficeHours](www.youtube.com/@OpenScienceOfficeHours)

Open Science Office Hours (OSOH) is an initiative of the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, supported by the McConnell Foundation.
